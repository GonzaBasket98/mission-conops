== Stakeholder Needs
 
The SeaLion Mission Concept of Operations (ConOps) is guided by a series of stakeholder needs, listed below.


=== 1.1: Primary Mission Objective A1
****
The SeaLion mission shall establish UHF communication link with Virginia ground station
**** 




=== 1.2: Primary Mission Objective A2
****
The SeaLion mission shall establish S-Band communication link with MC3 ground station
**** 




=== 1.3: Primary Mission Objective A3
****
The SeaLion mission shall successfully transmit “mission data” defined above to ground stations on the Earth.
**** 




=== 1.4: Primary Mission Objective A4
****
The SeaLion mission shall adhere to CubeSat standards as per CDS Rev. 13
****

=== 1.5: Primary Mission Objective A5
****
The SeaLion mission shall validate the operation of the Impedance Probe (IP) as a primary payload in-orbit.
**** 




=== 2.1: Secondary Mission Objective B1
****
The SeaLion mission shall provide a means to validate a V-Infrared Sensor (VIR-S) in-orbit
**** 




=== 2.2: Secondary Mission Objective B2
****
The SeaLion mission shall provide a means to validate a deployable composite structure (DeCS) in-orbit
**** 




=== 3.1: Tertiary Mission Objective C1
****
The SeaLion mission shall qualify on-orbit the deployment and functioning of the newly developed UHF antenna system and its deployment.
**** 




=== 3.2: Tertiary Mission Objective C2
****
The SeaLion mission shall qualify a CubeSat bus architecture for very-low Earth orbit (VLEO)
**** 




=== 3.3: Tertiary Mission Objective C3
****
The SeaLion shall verify DeCS in-orbit behavior performance via accelerometer & temperature sensor data
**** 





== User Stories

The SeaLion Mission Concept of Operations (ConOps)'s stakeholder needs are then used to identify a series of user stories which then lead to design decisions captured in data structure and activity definitions.


=== 1: Ping Satellite

****
As a *Ground Station Operator* I want to *Ping satellite* so that I can *Establish communication link with satellite*.
****

==== Example:

Ping the satellite in order to establish UHF communication link with Virginia ground station


==== *Derived From:*








=== 2: View Satellite Health Data Packet

****
As a *Ground Station Operator* I want to *View satellite health data packet* so that I can *Validate that satellite is operating nominally*.
****

==== Example:

View satellite health data packet in order to validate the mission data of the IP and DeCS payloads


==== *Derived From:*

* xref:{doc-name}#_1_3_primary_mission_objective_a3[Primary Mission Objective A3]








=== 2.1: Listen for Satellite Beacon

****
As a *Ground Station Operator* I want to *Open ground station beacon monitor* so that I can *View satellite health data packet*.
****

==== Example:

Open ground station beacon monitor to listen for satellite health data packet downlink


==== *Derived From:*




* xref:{doc-name}#_2_view_satellite_health_data_packet[View Satellite Health Data Packet]





=== 3: Update Beacon Rate

****
As a *Ground Station Operator* I want to *Update Beacon Rate* so that I can *Conserve power budget*.
****

==== Example:

Update beacon rate to transmit every 30 minutes to conserve power
